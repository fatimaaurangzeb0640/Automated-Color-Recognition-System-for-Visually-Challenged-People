# Automated-Color-Recognition-System-for-Visually-Challenged-People
This system is designed for
color blind people who cannot detect colors. It can also
be helpful to children for learning and memorizing the
names of the colors. The Arduino controlled model, using
a color sensor will detect the color. The color name will
be sent to mobile application using Bluetooth module
where it is converted from text to speech so that the user
can know and hear the name of the color of the object.
