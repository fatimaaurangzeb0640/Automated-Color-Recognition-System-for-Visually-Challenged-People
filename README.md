# Automated-Color-Recognition-System-for-Visually-Challenged-People
The Arduino controlled model, using
a color sensor, will detect the color. The color name will
be sent to mobile application using Bluetooth module
where it is converted from text to speech so the user
knows and hears the name of the color of the object.This system is designed for
color blind people. It can also
be helpful to children for learning and memorizing the
names of the colors.
